client-centric-todo-app
=======================

Actually it is a hype to provide a todo app as example projects to show some smart features of a framework.

In this case lift in combination with angular-js is used for this todo-app.

WHAT IS STILL WORKING:
- It is possible to create a 'normal' or 'important' todo task. To see some cool stuff, simply open another
browser instance and have a look for some comet magic ;-)

WHAT IS STILL NOT WORKING:
- The app is not finished yet!
- Some tiny bugs exists!
